--The character starts in a room.
--The description of the room is printed. The description 
should give the user a hint about what to do next.
--A > symbol is shown to prompt the user for input.
--There are 4 options for movement input: N for north, S for 
south, E for east and W for west.
--If the character is able to move in the direction (s)he chose,
 a description of the new room is printed and the prompt is 
 shown again for inputting additional movement commands or 
 special room-specific commands.
--If the character is not able to move in the direction (s)he 
chose, a game-appropriate error message must be shown and the
 description of the current room along with the prompt must 
 be repeated.
--A room's special commands can trigger any behavior desired.
 For example, if there are objects in the room, the user 
 could pick up the objects and use them. If the room has 
 another person in it the user could interact with the person.
 Use your imagination!
