Welcome to Kjorseyrr, my friend. You are in a little town in the west of Asgard. Here, as you can imagine, we are rude vikings who love to pillage and fight. But also, we like to party and sing the glories of old heroes.

# The Viking Pit

As vikings, all the population of the town have a series of basic attributes: Name, health, strength.

Let me introduce you to a little tradition we have here. The pit fights. It's just a way to measure our strength and show that we are true vikings.

A pit fight is really easy. You have two vikings that attack each other. Of course, some damage will be present, and it will reduce their health.

There is a maximum number of turns.

Here there's no winner. It's just a matter of honor and preparation for the battles to come. (This means that the pit fight should stop if one viking is close to death).

##Â Poor saxons...

One of our famous explorers has arrived from a long journey looking for easy towns to loot. He has found a little place that looks like easy gold and a bath of blood.

It's a town of saxon farmers with an abby full of golden cups and silver crucifixes.

In our code, saxons will have no name, and their health and strength will be set randomly, and really low compared with our epic vikings.

## The assault begins!

The Sun raises. They don't expect us. The slaughter begins. All the vikings start to shout their warcrys (this should be reflected in our program) and run to the town.

Chaos reigns. Nobody knows what is going on. But in the end, the result of the battle is defined by a random number of turns between 5 and 8.

For each turn, every viking selects an enemy randomly and causes damage equal to his strength, and also receiving damage equal to his enemy's strength, lowing his health.

If the enemy's or the viking's health goes below 0, they die.

At the end of the battle, the result will be the comparison between the Saxon casualties and the vikings casualties. Calculate the percentage of casualties of each side and then compare each one to define which side wins the battle.

## BONUS FOR VERY BRAVE VIKINGS - The Jarl calls his army

One thing that we didn't take into consideration was that when the Jarl organized the raid, he only called to arms all the vikings within the age to fight (between 15 and 45).

Once he has gathered the troops, he orders them to go to the armory. Each one of them will receive one weapon. In the armory we have axes, spears, bows and shields. Each one of them will give a bonus to one of the attributes of our vikings.
