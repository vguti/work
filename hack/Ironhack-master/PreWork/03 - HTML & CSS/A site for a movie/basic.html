					<p><strong>My Favourite Movie</strong></p>

					<p>At morning in Paris, Driss is driving <strong>Philippe's Maserati</strong> at high speed. They are chased through the streets by the police, and eventually cornered. Driss claims the <em>quadriplegic</em> Philippe must be urgently driven to the emergency room; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them to the hospital.</p>

					<p>The story of the friendship between the two men is then told as a flashback: Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic who owns a luxurious hôtel particulier, and his assistant Magalie, are interviewing candidates to be his live-in caregiver. Driss, a candidate, has no ambitions to get hired. He is just there to get a signature showing he was interviewed and rejected in order to continue receiving his welfare benefits. He is told to come back the next morning to get his signed letter.
