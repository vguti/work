### jQuery

#### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are one of the most effective ways to debug code. They enable you to pause script execution and then investigate the call stack and variable values at that particularmoment in time.There are two types of breakpoints atyour disposal: manual and conditional.

```jquery

	$('button').on('click', function () {

		});

```
**button** = Selector.

Example:

+ #my-id
+ .my-class
+ input

**click** = Event.

Example:

+ click
+ keypress
+ mouseenter

**function()** = Callback Function

+ This function will be called when the event is triggered

### Ajax

Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

It lets you send and recieve information from the server without reloading the page, like an invisible front-end ninja.

#### When would you use it?

Anytime you want to send information between the client and the server without leaving the current page.

+ **GET**: bring things
+ **POST**: put things
+ **PATCH**: update things
+ **DELETE**: what you think?

### APIs

+ **RESTful API**: Serve just data
+ **SOAP API**: Serve functionality

### JavaScript Pitfalls (Variable scope)

#### Block scope

Many, but not all, block-structured programming languages allow scope to be restricted to a block, which is known as block scope.

Most often this is contained whithin a function, thus restricting the scope to a part of a function.

#### Functional scope

Most of the commonly used programming languages offer a way to create a local variable in a function or subroutine.

A variable whose scope ends when the function returns.

In most cases the lifetime of the variable is the furation of the function call
